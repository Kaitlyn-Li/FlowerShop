This repo contains the website pages that I created for a local floral shop. This website by no means is the completed version but rather the skeleton of what the final product should look like. Website contains multiple pages including home page, about page, menu page, pricing page, contact page etc. Website is fully respoinsive that works well for different screen sizes and devices. 

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

## Optimizations: 

In time, I would like to add scheduling functionalities to the site where customers would be able o schedule a consultation with the owner.
