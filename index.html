                <h3>a note from Sarah</h3>
                <p>Thank you for your interest in beautiful florals for your wedding day! Our studio specializes in creating artistic designs led by the changing seasons that help deepen our connection to the natural world. </p>
                <p>When you walk through a wildflower meadow or a lush garden, notice the way blooms grow at different heights, the way they arch and bend towards the light to create a sense of airiness and movement. You’ll see vines climbing and weaving their way through neighboring plants and branches reaching out to provide a structural element to the landscape. </p>
                <p>Witnessing this untamed beauty is where our design process begins. We’re captivated by the organic shapes, colors, and textures we observe all around us in the natural world, and we use this as inspiration to communicate what we see through our work.</p>
                <p>We believe flowers are a gift that provides joy and delight, and that’s ultimately what we hope to provide for you. We’re glad you’re here.</p>

            <h3>“florals the guests could NOT stop raving about”</h3>
            <p>This review is going to be glowing - and it's still not going to do justice to the incredible work of Sarah at Flower. When we first saw photos of Sarah's arrangements online, we knew we'd have something really special but nothing could have prepared us for what she created for our event. Sarah took the beautiful fall palette of the Pacific Northwest and transformed our venue into an absolute riot of color that the guests could NOT stop raving about. Sarah just 'got' us and what we were going for, and we trusted her judgement to realize our vision. Given I had two guests ask if we were going to submit the photos to a magazine, I think we made the right call in trusting her!! You will not regret working with Flower for your wedding or special event.</p>

        <div class="statement">
            <h3>“every little detail of our flowers was PERFECT”</h3>
            <p>I still cannot get over how amazing our flowers were for our wedding day. I came into my consultation call with Sarah knowing very little about flower types or how to make it come together for our small wedding. I just knew I wanted yellow and let Sarah run with that, and I am so glad I did! Every little detail of our flowers was PERFECT, but the arch she created was truly one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. My husband had no opinions on flowers but commented multiple times throughout they day on how well they turned out. If Sarah is available on your date BOOK WITH HER. You will not regret it!</p>

        <div class="statement">
            <h3>“I felt so honored to display her workmanship”</h3>
            <p>Sarah is outstanding. I gave her one photograph and a single color palette to work with, and she absolutely nailed it. The flowers she used were fresh, perky, and exactly what I had in mind. Her style of flower arranging is very chic and modern, and I felt so honored to display her workmanship.</p>

        <div class="statement">
            <h3>“the arch she made for my wedding was GORGEOUS”</h3>
            <p>Sarah was wonderful, especially during a year that made us change our plans multiple times. The arch she made for my backyard wedding was GORGEOUS and totally captured the feel we were going for. I can't recommend her more.</p>
